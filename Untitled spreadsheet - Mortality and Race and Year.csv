Caveats:,,,,,,,,,
1. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:,,,,,,,,,
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable.,,,,,,,,,
2. About national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal,,,,,,,,,
estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts;,,,,,,,,,
population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1,,,,,,,,,
"resident population; population figures for 2011 are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, from",,,,,,,,,

http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Population Information.,,,,,,,,,
3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the,,,,,,,,,
resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group.,,,,,,,,,
4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the,,,,,,,,,
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis",,,,,,,,,
of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin,,,,,,,,,
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:",,,,,,,,,
